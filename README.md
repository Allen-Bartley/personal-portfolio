## 🛠️ Featured Projects

| Project | Domain | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [`windows-server-ad-lab`](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/windows-server-ad-lab) | 🖧 Networking | Constructed a dual-VM Active Directory lab using Windows Server 2022 and Windows 11 Education, scaffolded with guidance from Gemini (Google AI). Lab was designed to pre-stage domain services, DHCP, and NAT routing ahead of formal coursework with LinkedIn Learning or Udemy. Prioritized practical deployment over theoretical study to enable deeper hands-on learning and future certification readiness. |
| [`residential-network-architecture`](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/residential-network-architecture) | 🌐 Infrastructure | Designed and deployed a resilient home network within an inherited property undergoing restoration. Overcame Wi-Fi dead zones caused by structural paneling and lack of Ethernet runs by integrating powerline adapters with built-in access points. Extended connectivity to a study-dedicated library workstation and bedroom smart devices, enabling distraction-free coursework and reliable Roku/home automation access. Project reflects real-world problem solving, adaptive IT strategy, and infrastructure planning in non-ideal environments. |
| [`ai-assisted-portfolio-pipeline`](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/ai-assisted-portfolio-pipeline) | 🧾 Workflow / Documentation | Developed a repeatable portfolio documentation system using voice-to-text narration and Microsoft Copilot refinement. Enabled rapid conversion of spoken reflections into structured, recruiter-ready project blurbs. Showcases prompt engineering, iterative rewriting, and meta-workflow design for technical storytelling at scale. |
| [`stable-diffusion-vpn-access`](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/stable-diffusion-vpn-access) | 🧠 AI / VPN | Engineered a remote AI image generation pipeline using Stable Diffusion and Hamachi VPN to bypass laptop hardware limitations. Configured `--listen` mode in Automatic1111 to expose model endpoints over a private mesh network, enabling browser-based access to a GPU-powered desktop from a neighboring property. This setup allowed for off-site image creation and retrieval, with file transfers handled via VPN-based file sharing. Demonstrates creative adaptation of VPN infrastructure for personal AI workflows and resource-efficient design. |
| [`ender3-upgrade-project`](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/ender3-upgrade-project) | 🖨️ 3D Printing | Full hardware and firmware rebuild of a Creality Ender 3 with SKR Mini E3 board, BLTouch, dual Z-axis, and direct drive extruder. Includes custom wiring, thermal safety fix, and community-sourced firmware integration |
| [`personal-pc-build-2024`](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/personal-pc-build-2024) | 🛠️ Hardware | Documentation of a high-performance desktop build for 3D printing, AI workflows, and IT lab use. Includes component selection, BIOS tuning, thermal optimization, and post-build benchmarking |
| [`vinyl-digitization-guide`](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/vinyl-digitization-guide) | 🎵 Media | Personal documentation for capturing, cleaning, and archiving vinyl records with accurate tagging and signal flow |
| [`drive-cloning-migration`](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/drive-cloning-migration) | 💽 Backup | Step-by-step system drive cloning with Macrium Reflect and Windows prep workflows for data migration and recovery |
| [`artifact-recovery-lab`](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/artifact-recovery-lab) | 📚 Digital Preservation | Recovered and modernized legacy fanfiction and RPG forum archives originally authored in Microsoft Works format. Used ImgBurn to convert original folder structures into ISO media, deployed on a Windows 7 virtual machine to circumvent compatibility issues with modern systems. Files were restored and exported to modern Word formats for archival and personal study. Project highlights cross-era software emulation, metadata recovery, and personalized digital preservation efforts. |

## 📺 My Tech Journey

Born in 1982, I grew up alongside the rise of consumer computing. As a kid, I explored BASIC on our Atari system and played *Carmen Sandiego*, *Oregon Trail*, and *Frogger* on our Apple IIc. In the early 2000s, I was hooked on TechTV classics like *The Screen Savers* and *Call for Help*. These experiences built my intuition for hardware, troubleshooting, and systems integration.

From swapping out GPUs to building my first PC from scratch, I learned by doing. Today, that same mindset guides my network mapping, AI deployment, and continuous certification journey.

Technology isn’t just what I use—it’s what I grew up with, and what I continue to shape. 🔧📼🧠
