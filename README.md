Used ImgBurn to convert original folder structures into ISO media, deployed on a Windows 7 virtual machine to circumvent compatibility issues with modern systems. Files were restored and exported to modern Word formats for archival and personal study. Project highlights cross-era software emulation, metadata recovery, and personalized digital preservation efforts. |
| [`local-llm-deployment`](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/local-llm-deployment) | 🤖 AI / LLM | Documented the installation and configuration of LM Studio and Ollama for local chatbot experimentation on a high-performance Windows 11 workstation. Explores uncensored model behavior, prompt engineering, and persona modeling using quantized GGUF models. Includes system specs, model inventories, and philosophical framing around autonomy and ethical AI deployment. Designed as a reproducible sandbox for offline inference and narrative-driven testing. |
| [`windows-corruption-recovery`](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/windows-corruption-recovery) | 🔧 System Recovery | Documented comprehensive troubleshooting of deep Windows 11 corruption affecting installation processes and Windows Update functionality. Applied systematic diagnostic approach using DISM, SFC, and service management to isolate root causes. Developed offline installation workaround to bypass corrupted update components, successfully completing in-place upgrade while preserving user data.

## 📺 My Tech Journey

Born in 1982, I grew up alongside the rise of consumer computing. As a kid, I explored BASIC on our Atari system and played *Carmen Sandiego*, *Oregon Trail*, and *Frogger* on our Apple IIc. I also carried a **Royal DM70NX electronic organizer** through middle and high school—a flip-top device with a QWERTY-style keyboard, memo pad, scheduler, and calculator. It was my first hands-on experience with portable digital organization, sparking an early interest in modular systems and structured data long before smartphones.

In the early 2000s, I became a regular viewer of TechTV staples like *The Screen Savers* and *Call for Help*, learning troubleshooting methods and watching hardware builds unfold in real time. I later picked up a **brick-style Nokia phone** on a TracFone prepaid plan—indestructible and iconic, but prone to misdials from inside a pocket, sometimes consuming nearly all my minutes. To solve that, I upgraded to a **clamshell flip phone**, which prevented accidental dialing and shaped how I thought about physical design and user experience in mobile tech.

From swapping out GPUs to building my first PC from scratch, I learned by doing. Today, that same mindset guides my network mapping, AI deployment, and continuous certification journey. Technology isn’t just what I use—it’s what I grew up with, and what I continue to shape. 🔧📼🧠
