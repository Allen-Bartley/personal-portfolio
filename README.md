## 📺 My Tech Journey

Born in 1982, I grew up alongside the rise of consumer computing. As a kid, I explored BASIC on our Atari system and played *Carmen Sandiego*, *Oregon Trail*, and *Frogger* on our Apple IIc. In the early 2000s, I was hooked on TechTV classics like *The Screen Savers* and *Call for Help*. These experiences built my intuition for hardware, troubleshooting, and systems integration.

From swapping out GPUs to building my first PC from scratch, I learned by doing. Today, that same mindset guides my network mapping, AI deployment, and continuous certification journey.

Technology isn’t just what I use—it’s what I grew up with, and what I continue to shape. 🔧📼🧠
