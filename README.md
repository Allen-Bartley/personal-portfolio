## 🧭 Building From the Ground Up: My Journey Into IT

> *This section outlines how I transformed real-life obstacles into a powerful home lab portfolio.*

You'll find that this portfolio is more than just a list of projects—it's the result of a decade-long commitment to building and documenting enterprise-level skills in an environment with limited local tech opportunities. Living in Boone County, West Virginia, meant that to pursue my passion for technology, I had to create my own experience. This portfolio is the story of that journey.

### Turning Problems into Projects

Nearly every project documented here began as a solution to a real-world problem faced by me or my family. My home lab was not just for abstract learning; it was our production environment.

- **When my mother wanted to watch decades-old family videos**, it led to the [Analog Revival Hub](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/analog-revival-hub), a project focused on empathy and user comfort through VHS to Roku streaming workflows.
- **When Wi-Fi dead zones plagued our family's inherited property**, it resulted in the [Residential Network Architecture](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/residential-network-architecture) project, a complete overhaul to ensure reliable connectivity for work and daily life.
- **When a family laptop was crippled by system corruption**, I engineered the [Windows Corruption Recovery](https://github.com/Allen-Bartley/windows-corruption-recovery) workflow to perform a full repair while preserving all their precious data.

This philosophy of practical, user-centric problem-solving is the foundation of all my work.

### Dedication, Readiness, and the Road to Remote

For over a decade, my professional life involved a daily commute of up to 1.5 hours to the Charleston area for the best available on-site tech roles. For just as long, my ability to pursue remote work was limited by a bonded DSL connection with upload speeds of just 1Mbps.

This environment shaped my approach: I had to be self-reliant, which is why these projects are solo endeavors. I had to be dedicated, and I had to find a way to keep growing. Now, with the recent arrival of gigabit fiber to my home, those constraints are gone.

I am actively seeking a fully remote role where I can bring this passion, resilience, and proven history of problem-solving to a collaborative team. With gigabit access and deep hands-on experience, I'm now ready to contribute to a fully remote technical team solving enterprise-scale challenges.

## 📺 My Tech Journey

Born in 1982, I grew up alongside the rise of consumer computing. As a kid, I explored BASIC on our Atari system and played *Carmen Sandiego*, *Oregon Trail*, and *Frogger* on our Apple IIc. I also carried a **Royal DM70NX electronic organizer** through middle and high school—a flip-top device with a QWERTY-style keyboard, memo pad, scheduler, and calculator. It was my first hands-on experience with portable digital organization, sparking an early interest in modular systems and structured data long before smartphones.

In the early 2000s, I became a regular viewer of TechTV staples like *The Screen Savers* and *Call for Help*, learning troubleshooting methods and watching hardware builds unfold in real time. I later picked up a **brick-style Nokia phone** on a TracFone prepaid plan—indestructible and iconic, but prone to misdials from inside a pocket, sometimes consuming nearly all my minutes. To solve that, I upgraded to a **clamshell flip phone**, which prevented accidental dialing and shaped how I thought about physical design and user experience in mobile tech.

From swapping out GPUs to building my first PC from scratch, I learned by doing. Today, that same mindset guides my network mapping, AI deployment, and continuous certification journey. Technology isn’t just what I use—it’s what I grew up with, and what I continue to shape. 🔧📼🧠
